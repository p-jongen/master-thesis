Study of the routing and the potential security risks of the Starlink satellite constellation

# Description
This topic would require to study the functioning of the Starlink constellation, more specifically how the routing works. Additionally to reading the documentation and the paper currently available on the subject, it would be important to experiment it by using Traceroute in order to better understand the path a packet could take. 
Once enough data is collected and the routing understood, the goal would be to analyse these data and find various attacks that could potentially occure in the Starlink constellation. As an example, we could analyse if it is possible to overload a satellite or if the route taken by a packets is predictible.
RIPE Atlas will also be used in order to gather more data that has been made available by other others poeple probe using starlink. It could therefore be interesting to make public some measurement made on the Starlink network.
